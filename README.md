# Bus Usage Time Series Project

This project aimed to forecast the future demand for buses in 10 different municipalities based on their past usage data. The goal was to provide accurate predictions for the required number of buses in the future, allowing municipalities to better plan and optimize their public transportation systems.


# Project Overview

To achieve my goal, I utilized time series modeling techniques to analyze historical data and identify patterns and trends. I cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure its quality and consistency, and then used a variety of statistical models, including ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, to forecast the future demand for buses.

# The project involved the following steps:

1)Data collection and preprocessing

2)Exploratory data analysis

3)Feature engineering

4)Model selection and training

5)Model evaluation and selection of the best performing model

6)Forecasting future bus usage and generating predictions

# Results
My analysis and modeling efforts resulted in accurate predictions of future bus usage for all 10 municipalities. I was able to identify trends and patterns in the data, which allowed us to make informed decisions about which models to use and how to fine-tune their parameters.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated the potential of time series modeling techniques to forecast future demand for public transportation. I hope that my work can contribute to better planning and optimization of bus services in municipalities, ultimately improving the quality of life for residents.
